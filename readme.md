## ssMain (FKA PiAtAGlance)

**ssMain** is a client data management tool for Proteledata's TAS Pinnacle program utilizing a Rest API

## Set up

This application will not work without a Rest API server (contact Royce at ITAS)  
You will need to set environmental variables to provide credentials (see /src/server/index)

## Current State

I've disabled the file management tool until I can complete it for this version
