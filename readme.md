ssMain is a data client viewing tool for Proteledata's Pinnacle TAS management program utilizing ITAS Solutions Rest API

For Pinnacle users:

This application will not work without a Rest API server (contact Royce at ITAS)
You'll also need to create a global.js in the root directory to provide credentials for the Rest requests

Everyone else:

the documentation is a bit sparse, I've tried to add comments where it looks necessary
I've disabled the file management tool until I can complete it for this version
unit testing was added after the fact, expect more to come.

Please send any questions / comments to me at ewaters@bpeinc.com
