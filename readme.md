## ssMain (FKA PiAtAGlance)

**ssMain** is a client data management tool for Proteledata's TAS Pinnacle program utilizing a Rest API by ITAS Solutions

## Pinnacle users:

This application will not work without a Rest API server (contact Royce at ITAS)  
You will need to set environmental variables to provide credentials (see /src/server/index)  
I've disabled the file management tool until I can complete it for this version

## Everyone else:

The documentation is a bit sparse, I've tried to add comments where it looks necessary
Unit tests were added after the fact: expect more to come.
