**ssMain** is a client data management tool for Proteledata's TAS Pinnacle program utilizing a Rest API set up by ITAS Solutions

# Pinnacle users:

   This application will not work without a Rest API server (contact Royce at ITAS)  
   You will need to create a global.js in the root directory to provide credentials for the Rest requests  
   I've disabled the file management tool until I can complete it for this version  

# Everyone else:

   the documentation is a bit sparse, I've tried to add comments where it looks necessary  
   unit testing was added after the fact, expect more to come.  

## Please send any questions / comments to me at ewaters@bpeinc.com
